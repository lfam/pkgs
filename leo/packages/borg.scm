    (synopsis "Deduplicated, encrypted, authenticated and compressed backups")
    (description "Borg is a deduplicating backup program.  Optionally, it
supports compression and authenticated encryption.  The main goal of Borg is to
provide an efficient and secure way to backup data.  The data deduplication
technique used makes Borg suitable for daily backups since only changes are
stored.  The authenticated encryption technique makes it suitable for backups
to not fully trusted targets.")

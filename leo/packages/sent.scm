    (synopsis "Simple plaintext presentation tool")
    (description "Uses plaintext files and PNG images to create slideshow
presentations.  Each paragraph represents a slide in the presentation.
Especially for presentations using the Takahashi method this is very nice and
allows you to write down the presentation for a quick lightning talk within a
few minutes.")
